* Intro to Go

What is Go:

- developed at Google, 2007
- by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson
- statically typed (with duck typing)
- type safe, garbage collected
- syntax resembles C
- batteries included - stdlib
- win/mac arm/amd/intel support with cross compilation

    "When the three of us got started, it was pure research. The three of us got
    together and decided that we hated C++. We started off with the idea that all
    three of us had to be talked into every feature in the language, so there was
    no extraneous garbage put into the language for any reason."

- Rob

* Tao of Go

*Less is more*

- minimal, clean language spec
- no classes, type hierarchy
- no syntax sugar
- OCD friendly (go fmt, compiler error: unused var/import)

    "There has been much talk about component architectures but only one true
    success: Unix pipes."

- Rob

* Hello world

.play hello.go

Did you know: Rob Pike is the co-author of the UTF-8 spec

* FizzBuzz

Here, now go apply for a Go programming role!

.play fizzbuzz.go

* Type, structs

.play types.go

.play structs.go

* More syntax examples

- while True => `for { }`
- import pkg as alias .. => import alias "pkg"
- Print(*args) => func Print(comments ...string)
- named returns => func Print (s string) (err error)
- with => defer

* Interaces

.play interfaces.go

* Goroutines

.play goroutines.go

* Channels

.play channels.go

* Things I liked

- static typing
- minimalism
- deployment
- tooling - godef, gocode

* Things I didn't like

- debugging
- if err != nil
